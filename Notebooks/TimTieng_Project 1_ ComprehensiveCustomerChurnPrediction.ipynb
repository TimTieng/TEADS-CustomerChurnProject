    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project activity, you will dive into analyzing customer data from a business to predict churn risk comprehensively. You will not only apply traditional supervised learning algorithms such as decision trees and random forests but also explore logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to identify key churn factors. This expanded scope will enhance your understanding of different model assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses, enabling you to build a robust model to target potential churners effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will:\n",
    "- **Evaluate** different supervised learning algorithms to understand their suitability for churn prediction.\n",
    "- **Implement** data preprocessing techniques tailored to the requirements of each algorithm.\n",
    "- **Optimize** model parameters to improve prediction accuracy.\n",
    "- **Interpret** the model outcomes to extract actionable insights for retention campaigns.\n",

From a business perspective, we may need to study customer propensity to include one service based on the services the customer currently pays for. This can increase market capture for the business writ-large. (Bundling services to a subscription)\n",

This could be a business opportunity to focus on members with lower levels of internet service to upgrade potentially reducing the likliness of leaving our service for a competitor.\n",
    "5. Churn - Top value is \"no\" with a frequency count of 5174/7043. This attribute should be used in future analysis"

This may highlight that these customers are only paying for a single service (internet, phone, etc). From a business/market capture perspective, we can view this as potential customer base to target with the goal of motivating them to add more services to their subscription. The right end of the graph may represent customers who pay for premium-like services or combines multiple service offerings to their subscription. \n",
    "3. **TotalCharges Distributio**n**: This attribute has a long trailing tail towards the right of the graph. Additionally, there are alot of customers with a low \"TotalCharges\" value. This is aligned with teh MonthlyCharges column and may be attributed to the customer base only paying for 1 service. \n",

    "3. Tenure vs Monthly Charges - There is a slightly positive relationship between these two attributes. This suggests that as tenure increases, monthyl charges also increase slightly since they are positively correlated, although weak. This is an interesting anamoly as businesses tend to \"reward\" long-term customers or value their business throughout the years. This could be the business' approach to handle inflation."
