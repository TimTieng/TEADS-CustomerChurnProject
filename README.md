# Tech Excellence Advanced Data Science Project 1: Customer Churn

**Group Members**: Tim Tieng, Scott Mayer

**Project Overvieww**
In this project activity, you will dive into analyzing customer data from a business to predict churn risk comprehensively. You will not only apply traditional supervised learning algorithms such as decision trees and random forests but also explore logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to identify key churn factors. This expanded scope will enhance your understanding of different model assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses, enabling you to build a robust model to target potential churners effectively.
